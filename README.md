#ReadMe

This repo contains the code for my master thesis about adaptive sampling with intermittent communication for heterogeneous robot teams.

##Environment Setup

First you need to install a couple libraries to be able to execute the code. The code is written in python version 3.7.1 under Ubuntu 18.04.
Setup instructions are executed using the command line so you will need to work with the terminal and you need sudo access.

###Project source code

First, clone the repository using the following command:  
`git@github.com:HannesRovina/AdaptiveSamplingIntermittentComms.git`

###Install python

`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install python3.7`

###Install libraries

The project uses numpy, matplotlib and networkx.

####Numpy, scipy and matplotlib

`sudo apt-get install python-pip`
